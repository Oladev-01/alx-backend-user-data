# 0x00. Personal Data

## Overview

This project focuses on the fundamentals of handling personal data securely. It aims to raise awareness about the risks of exposing sensitive data and explores techniques for anonymizing and protecting personal data in applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

1. **Understand personal data**: Recognize what constitutes personal data and the importance of protecting it.
2. **Identify best practices**: Learn industry-standard practices for handling sensitive information.
3. **Apply data anonymization**: Implement techniques to anonymize or obfuscate sensitive data to protect user privacy.
4. **Handle data in logs**: Properly manage sensitive data in logging and error reporting, ensuring that no personal information is inadvertently exposed.
5. **Understand GDPR**: Gain an understanding of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its relevance to managing personal data.

## Key Concepts

- **Personal Data**: Any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc.
  
- **Data Anonymization**: The process of removing personally identifiable information (PII) from data to ensure that individuals cannot be identified.

- **Data Masking**: A method of hiding or altering sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, to prevent unauthorized access while keeping functionality intact.

- **Best Practices for Logs**: Techniques for ensuring that sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages, such as using safe logging functions or redacting certain fields.

- **Security**: Emphasizing the importance of securing personal data, including encryption, hashing, and proper data storage techniques to prevent data breaches.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: The programming language used to demonstrate examples of how to handle and protect personal data.

- **Logging Frameworks**: Demonstrating how to configure logging frameworks to avoid storing personal data in log files.

- **Hashing and Encryption**: Techniques for securely storing personal data, such as passwords.
