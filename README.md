# 0x00. Personal Data

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding how to handle, protect, and anonymize personal data in compliance with privacy laws and best practices. It highlights the importance of securing sensitive information in any system or application.

## Objectives

- Learn the concept of **personal data** and its importance.
- Understand the significance of data **anonymization** and **masking**.
- Implement techniques for protecting sensitive information in logs and error messages.
- Adhere to industry-standard practices for securing personal data.

## Key Concepts

1. **Personal Data**: Information related to an individual, such as names, email addresses, social security numbers, etc., that must be protected.
2. **Anonymization**: The process of removing personally identifiable information (PII) from data sets, so that individuals cannot be identified.
3. **Data Masking**: Masking or obfuscating personal data to hide sensitive information in logs, databases, or systems while maintaining functionality.

## Key Topics

- **Logging**: Properly log information while avoiding exposing sensitive data.
- **Obfuscation**: Use techniques to obfuscate sensitive fields like credit card numbers or social security numbers.
- **Security Practices**: Best practices for protecting personal data in code and during communication.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The project will be implemented in Python, focusing on secure handling of data.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:

1. Understand the different types of personal data and their impact on privacy.
2. Be able to implement data anonymization and masking techniques.
3. Learn how to avoid exposing sensitive data in logs and error messages.
4. Implement security mechanisms to handle personal data safely and responsibly.

## Usage
